## First impressions

I have some experience with markdown in the past to create small HTML pages, but nothing as sophisticated as Jekyll that supports a lot of formatting options and even some nicely highlighted code blocks.

```python
print(math.sqrt(4))

# => 2
```

I think it's a bit restrictive that the post dates are tied to the file naming convention (
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`), it seems to me like it would be a lot more powerful if Jekyll supported some sort of in-file parameters for determining post date---amongst other things such as tags, modified dates, etc. I still vastly prefer Emacs' Org mode for this sort of output but I don't know of any frameworks and templates that make it so easy to start a little blog using Org mode.
