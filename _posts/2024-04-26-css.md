## Base
The style of this blog comes from the [fastai/fast_template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template) that was used to generate the starting template. It is based on the `minima` Jekyll theme.

## Overall style
The style of this blog has a few heavy inspirations. One of which is the Financial Times[^1] from where the lovely salmon background color came from. Next, much of the typography choices have been heavily influenced by Matthew Butt­erick's[^3] *Practical Typography*[^4]. Most notably the convention of signalling URLs with a small unicode circle (°) instead of any colouring or fontification differences.
