# Paddy Disease Classification (Part 1)

## What is it?
The [paddy disease classification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/paddy-disease-classification/) is a rather small challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)[^1] to classify paddy leaf diseases based on the provided dataset of 10,407 images.

It can be attempted rather easily (compared to the other challenges) with a bit of knowledge of FastAI and some python packages like `fastkaggle`.

## Getting started
Thanks to `fastkaggle`, it is rather easy to get going,

```python
setup_comp('paddy-disease-classification', install='fastai "timm>=0.6.2.dev0"')
```
A neat trick that working through a tutorial for this challenge has taught me is to always explicitly specify your seed values when developing for reproducibility.

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *
set_seed(42)
```

## Tricks for improved results
### To squish or not to squish?
It turns out that "squishing" images to fit the desired resolution is not always ideal, sometimes letterboxing can produce better results and is worth investigating (along with the other image shrinking techniques).

### Augmentation
Augmentation of the images can help to provide a wider variety of training data if the dataset is rather uniform. For example it can include automatic application of random contrast changes, scaling, brightness changes, tilting, etc.
