## Shrinking images
Many deep learning models are trained on a specific image size, which necessitates the fine tuning dataset to match. Alternatively, some resolution-independent models exist (such as `resnet18`), however, it is usually desired to limit the input images to a certain size in order to speed up and lower hardware requirements for training and later recognition. The simplest method of this is cropping or "squishing"

## Test time augmentation
TTA or test time augmentation can be used to automatically apply certain transformations to the incoming data such as:
 - Altering brightness
 - Flipping
 - Scaling (zooming)
 - Slight rotation
 - Warping
