## Blog
I am an BEng/BMath student at the University of Queensland. This little blog has been completed as part of one of my courses ELEC4630, on image recognition.

The first few posts here will follow my journey getting setup with a Jekyll blog and being introduced to the world of fastai and deep learning.
